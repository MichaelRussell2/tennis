1) cleaning data

->Which stats do we actually have access to? Remove null data columns

2) analysis
   Repeat winner fraction vs. number unforced errors with: 
	* number of aces
	* number of winners
	* number of double faults
	* number of net points

How does this change with surface?
How are these numbers correlated with each other?

How important is ‘momentum’??

Generally, which number is the best predictor of win vs. loss?
Plot distributions of number of aces, number of winners, etc for winners and losers
